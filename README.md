# template-api

A small Fastify + TypeScript service with MongoDB built in. Bun runs it and Biome keeps it tidy. With no configuration at all, dev and tests spin up a throwaway in-memory MongoDB, so `bun install && bun run dev` is genuinely all it takes to get going.

> **Applicants:** do not open pull requests here (they are closed automatically). Work in your own copy and submit as instructed in your application materials.

## What you need

Bun 1.4.2 or newer. Older versions break the MongoDB driver; 1.3.14 will not work. Docker is only worth installing if you want a database that survives restarts.

## Running it

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```

That serves http://localhost:3000. The first run downloads an in-memory MongoDB binary, roughly 150 MB, once. After that it's cached and startup is quick. If you'd rather have persistent data:

```sh
docker compose up -d
cp .env.example .env
```

## Environment

Everything here is optional. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set what you need.

| Variable | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB URI for dev. Unset means in-memory. |
| `MONGO_TEST_URI` | Same thing, but for `bun test`. |
| `AUTH_SKIP` | Set to `true` to turn auth off locally. |

## Scripts

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run dev` | Dev server, watch mode, debug logs |
| `bun run start` | Same without watch, info logs |
| `bun run test` | Tests, with coverage |
| `bun run compile` | Type-check `src` and `test` with `tsc` |
| `bun run check` | Read-only formatting + lint check |
| `bun run lint` | Auto-fix lint issues |
| `bun run fmt` | Auto-format the repo |

## Auth

Users and their tokens live in `src/auth/users.ts`. There are two sample users, alice and bob, and their tokens act as passwords, so replace them before deploying anything real. Protected routes want a bearer header:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/auth-example
# 401 Missing Authorization Header

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer alice-dev-token" http://localhost:3000/auth-example
# alice
```

To protect your own routes, wrap them in a `fastify.withAuth` scope. Everything inside is protected, the auth error responses get documented for you, and `request.user` is typed non-null:

```typescript
const authExample: FastifyPluginAsync = async (
  fastify: FastifyTypebox,
): Promise<void> => {
  fastify.withAuth(async (fastify) => {
    fastify.get(
      "/",
      {
        schema: {
          summary: "Auth Example",
          tags: ["Auth"],
          security: [{ Auth: [] }],
          response: {
            200: Type.String({
              description: "The authenticated user's username.",
            }),
          },
        },
      },
      async (request) => request.user.username,
    );
  });
};
```

Setting `AUTH_SKIP=true` turns verification off completely. Scoped requests then come in as a fixed anonymous user (`{ username: "anonymous", name: null }`, plus an `X-Auth-Skip: true` response header), and stale tokens in your HTTP client stop causing mystery 401s.

  mongo.test.ts         # Full-app boot + in-memory MongoDB wiring
  options.test.ts       # Env parsing tests
```

## Tests

`bun run test` runs everything. Route tests exercise each plugin on a bare Fastify instance; the Mongo test boots the whole app, plugins autoloaded and collections created, against the in-memory server unless `MONGO_TEST_URI` is set. No external services anywhere.

## Adding your own stuff

New routes go in a folder under `src/routes/`; the autoload picks them up, and an exported `autoPrefix` controls the URL prefix if you want one. New collections and their indexes go in `src/plugins/init-mongo.ts`, following the `example` pattern, and show up as `fastify.collections.<name>`.
